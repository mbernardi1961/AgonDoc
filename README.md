# Newbie FAQ for AgonLight2

<bold>For new owners of the AgonLight2 who wish to upgrade the Quark Firmware</bold><br>
The Argon microcomputer was designed to allow its firmware to be upgraded, but initially it required special hardware to do so.
In January 2023 a software solution was developed which can be found at github.com/envenomator/agon-flash/ .
The latest version allows MOS version 1.03 and VDP 1.04 to be updated without any additional hardware.
